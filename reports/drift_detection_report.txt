# DATA DRIFT DETECTION REPORT
Generated: 2026-02-16 16:18:53

## Executive Summary
- Total Features Monitored: 7
- Features with Drift: 0 (0.0%)
- Overall Status: ✓ NO DRIFT DETECTED

## Drift Detection Methodology
- PSI (Population Stability Index) Threshold: 0.1
  - PSI > 0.1 suggests moderate drift
- KS Test P-value Threshold: 0.05
  - P-value < 0.05 indicates statistically significant distribution shift
