# COST-SENSITIVE THRESHOLD OPTIMIZATION REPORT
Generated: 2026-02-12 19:27:57.237551

## Business Cost Parameters
- Cost of False Negative (Missed Fraud): $100.00
  (Chargeback liability + investigation cost)
- Cost of False Positive (False Alarm): $5.00
  (Customer friction + transaction decline cost)

## Optimal Threshold Analysis
- **Recommended Threshold: 0.290**
- **Minimum Total Cost: $15100.00**
- Cost per fraud detected: $100.00

## Cost Comparison
- Default Threshold (0.5) Cost: $15100.00
- Potential Savings: $0.00 (0.0%)

## Performance at Optimal Threshold
Confusion Matrix:
  - True Positives (Frauds Caught): 0
  - False Positives (False Alarms): 0
  - True Negatives (Correct Approvals): 9849
  - False Negatives (Missed Frauds): 151

Key Metrics:
  - Fraud Detection Rate (Recall): 0.0000 (0.00%)
  - Precision (Accuracy of positive predictions): 0.0000 
  - ROC-AUC Score: 0.5607

## Cost Breakdown
- False Negative Cost: $15100.00 (151 missed frauds × $100.0)
- False Positive Cost: $0.00 (0 false alarms × $5.0)
- **Total Operating Cost: $15100.00**

## Recommendations
1. **Threshold Update**: Change decision threshold from 0.5 to 0.290
   - Reduces total operational cost by 0.0%
   - Balances fraud detection vs. customer friction

2. **Monitoring**: Track false positive rate weekly
   - Target: 0.0% precision (minimize customer disruption)
   - Ensure fraud detection rate ≥ 0.0%

3. **Customer Communication**: Prepare for 0 potential false alarms per 10000 transactions
   - Reduced verification time with new threshold
   - Improved customer experience

4. **Cost Recovery**: Monitor chargebacks and costs monthly
   - Expected savings: $0.00
   - Adjust threshold if fraud patterns change

## Implementation Steps
1. Update model serving code to use threshold 0.290
2. Deploy to fraud detection API/pipeline
3. Monitor precision and recall in production
4. Re-optimize threshold monthly with new data
