## Feature Importance Analysis
The model learned to detect fraud using the following key patterns:

### Top 5 Most Important Features

1. **device_trust_score** (0.2299)
   - Fraudsters often use untrusted devices
   - This is the strongest signal in the model

2. **amount** (0.1713)
   - Transaction amount indicates fraud likelihood
   - Unusual amounts (very high/low) may indicate fraud

3. **cardholder_age** (0.1604)
   - Age influences fraud susceptibility
   - Age-based spending patterns are distinct

4. **transaction_hour** (0.1333)
   - Fraud often occurs at unusual times
   - Time-of-day patterns help identify anomalies

5. **velocity_last_24h** (0.1240)
   - Multiple transactions in short time = fraud signal
   - Unusual activity velocity is a strong indicator


## All Features Ranked by Importance
 1. device_trust_score             0.229876
 2. amount                         0.171268
 3. cardholder_age                 0.160406
 4. transaction_hour               0.133344
 5. velocity_last_24h              0.123958
 6. merchant_category              0.079788
 7. location_mismatch              0.068250
 8. foreign_transaction            0.033110


## Model Interpretation
- **Model Type**: Random Forest Classifier (100 trees)
- **Total Features**: 8
- **Feature Encoding**: Categorical features label-encoded

## How Fraud Detection Works
1. Device Trust Score: Highest weight - fraudsters use untrusted devices
2. Transaction Amount: Size of transaction is informative
3. Cardholder Age: Age-based spending patterns are distinct
4. Transaction Hour: Fraud often happens at unusual hours
5. Velocity: Multiple transactions quickly signal fraud

## Recommendations for Business
1. **High Priority**: Monitor device trust scores
   - Require additional verification for low trust devices
   - Adjust device trust calculation based on feedback

2. **Medium Priority**: Review transaction amounts
   - Set category-specific limits
   - Flag large deviations from customer average

3. **Continuous Monitoring**: Track feature distributions
   - Watch for shifts in customer behavior
   - Update model quarterly with new patterns

## Feature Stability
Features show stable distributions across the dataset, indicating 
the model should generalize well to new data.
